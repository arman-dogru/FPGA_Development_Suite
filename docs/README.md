# FPGA Development Suite

## Introduction
The FPGA Development Suite is a comprehensive set of tools designed for FPGA development, focusing on simulation, synthesis, verification, and optimization of FPGA designs. This suite includes a user-friendly interface for editing hardware description languages (HDL) such as VHDL and Verilog.

## Installation
To install the FPGA Development Suite, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arman-dogru/FPGA_Development_Suite.git
cd fpga-development-suite
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
To start the FPGA Development Suite, run the following command:

```bash
fpga_dev_suite
```

### HDL Editor
- Open the HDL Editor from the main menu.
- Write your VHDL or Verilog code in the editor.
- Use syntax highlighting and auto-completion features to improve your coding experience.

### Simulation
- Select the simulation tool from the main menu.
- Load your HDL code and run the simulation.
- View the simulation results in the output window.

### Synthesis
- Select the synthesis tool from the main menu.
- Load your HDL code and set the synthesis parameters.
- Run the synthesis and view the results.

### Verification
- Select the verification tool from the main menu.
- Choose between functional and formal verification.
- Load your HDL code and run the verification.
- View the verification results in the output window.

### Optimization
- Select the optimization tool from the main menu.
- Load your HDL code and set the optimization parameters.
- Run the optimization and view the results.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, please refer to the following steps:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Check the syntax of your HDL code.
- Refer to the logs for detailed error messages.
